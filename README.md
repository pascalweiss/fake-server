# Fake Server

Sometimes I want to check, if a peace of software actually sends http requests. Normally, 
when I have control over the sender and the receiver, this is quite easy, since I can simply look into the logs.

But sometimes, my peace of software is a blackbox, e.g. a certain dependency, that I included into my application. 
I may struggle with the configuration, and don't get any logs, and I am not able to see the incoming requests in my receiver.

I solved this by implementing a little http server with the following properties:
- It accepts all kinds of requests...
- prints them out...
- and returns 200

It is provided as a docker-compose.


### Integration into envi
In my own shell configuration (dotfiles and so on), the server can be started with the command.

`fake-server <port>`
